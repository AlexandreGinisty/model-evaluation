\label{subsec:abstaction}
The MoRC model has been made by direct translation of the specification described
in ERTMS subset-026-3.5 In order to keep the complexity low, some
abstractions have been made. The model's behavior would be refined in a next step
of the model's design process. In a first step we focus on the communication
protocol between the MoRC and the RTM. This leads us to abstract some behaviors.

First, our representation will not consider the interfaces with the JRU
since it only recorded existing signals and is not relevant for tests
generation
Secondly, the orders coming from BTM, DMI, EVC will be abstracted as only one message
from the on-board. This message will indicate that a communication session
should be started or be ended. We will not distinguished between the different
events that may occurred since they follow the same connection protocol. Moreover the discrimination
between these events is not well defined in the specification, we will assume
that the decision is taken by another task of the EVC and that the MoRC task only
 starts or terminates a radio communication
Finally, the output messages from MoRC to DMI are not considered for the first version.
