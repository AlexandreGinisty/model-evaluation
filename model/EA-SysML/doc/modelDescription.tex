\section{Model description}
\label{sec:modeldescription}
The radio communication management module (MoRC) is the user application interacting
with Euroradio protocol. In the following model only the general behaviour is
presented, the actual details of how messages are transported are not relevant
for this description.
% ----------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Interfaces}
\label{subsec:interfaces}


The MoRC is the part of the EVC (European vital computer) responsible for the
management of radio communication.
According to the specification this module interacts directly with the following
on-board modules, as shown in figure \ref{fig:arch}: 
\begin{itemize}
\item (DMI) driver module interface~: receives/displays information from/to the driver,
\item (RTM) radio transmission module~: receives/gives commands from/to the radio
network,
\item (BTM) balise transmission module~: sends transmission request from a balise group,
\item (JRU) Juridical recorder unit~: records part of the data exchange for
\item (OBU tasks) other on-board functions (cf. Subset-026-4.5) used  by the MoRC such as:
\begin{itemize}
\item track conditions managment function  (Subset-026-3.12.1)
for example determine if the ECTS system of the track is compatible with the
system on-board.
\item debug purpose.
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\end{figure}

The orders to initiate or terminates a radio communication may come from the
DMI, the BTM, and the RBC (radio block centre) through the RTM. The EVC may also order a radio
communication the subsection \ref{subsec:inputoutput} will give more details.
 on how we have modelled this.
% ----------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Abstraction}
\label{subsec:abstaction}
The MoRC model has been made by direct translation of the specification described
in ERTMS subset-026-3.5 In order to keep the complexity low, some
abstractions have been made. The model's behaviour would be refined in a next step
of the model's design process. In a first step we focus on the communication
protocol between the MoRC and the RTM. This leads us to abstract some behaviours.

First, our representation will not consider the interfaces with the JRU
since it only recorded existing signals and is not relevant for tests
generation
Secondly, the orders coming from BTM, DMI, EVC will be abstracted as only one message
from the on-board. This message will indicate that a communication session
should be started or be ended. We will not distinguished between the different
events that may occured since they follow the same connection protocol. Moreover the discrimination
between these events is not well defined in the specification, we will assume
that the decision is taken by another task of the EVC and that the MoRC task only
 starts or terminates a radio communication
Finaly, the output messages from MoRC to DMI are not considered for the first version.

\subsection{Inputs and outputs messages}
\label{subsec:inputoutput}

Figure \ref{fig:interfaces} shows the messages exchanged at the interface of
the radio communication managment module. The numbers in brackets represent the maximal value the message
may have. Note that in a first version the communication will only be set up
with an RBC, communication with a RIU (radio in-fill unit) are not taken
into account.

\subsubsection{RTM interface}
\verb+MessageOut+, \verb+MessageIn+ are the Euroradio messages, their
possible values are defined in the subset-026-8.4 and the subset-026-7.4. The
test cases define by the subset-076 are performed by analysing the recording of
these messages. In our model we have consider only the relevant messages.
Furthermore, messages are decomposed in variable and packets, these are not
taken into account by our modeling. Our model considers messages only as a number corresponding to an action. 
Table \ref{table:Messages} summarizes the considered messages, the message name
are those used in the model, Id and Packets are those defined in Subset-026-7
and Subset-026-8.

\begin{table}[htbp]
  \begin{tabular}{lclp{.4\textwidth}}\hline
  Message Name & Id & Packets& Description \\\hline
  \verb+TERM_SESSION_TRACK+& 24 & Packet 42 ; Q\_RBC = 0& The RBC orders the EVC to {\bf terminate} a communication with RBC \\

\begin{description}
\item \verb+NID_Rbc+ identifies the RBC it joins the \verb+NID_RBC+ and
\verb+NID_C+ (Subset026-3).
\item \verb+setUp+,\verb+reqSetUp+,\verb+releaseSetUp+ messages are used for setting
or releasing a safe radio communication.
\item \verb+radioHole+ may have the value \verb+BEGIN+, \verb+INSIDE+,
\verb+END+ or
\verb+NONE+ regarding if the train enters, leaves or is in a announced radioHole 
are compatible.
\end{description}

\subsubsection{Interface with others on board functions}
The different cases to initiate or terminate a communication have been abstract
by a single signal. Since the behavior is the same regardless the different
events, we assume that others tasks of the EVC will activate the signal wen
needed.

\begin{description}
\item \verb+orderOnBoard+ represents the order from the on-board EVC to initiate
or terminate a communication. The possible values are the following ones~: 
  \begin{itemize}
  \item \verb+NONE+:  no order;
  \item \verb+INIT+ represents one of these cases :
	\begin{itemize}
	\item Start of mission procedure,
	\item Report a mode change,
	\item Driver change level to 2 or 3,
	\item End of a radio hole,
	\item The balise group orders a radio communication.
	\end{itemize}
  \item \verb+TERM+ represents one of these cases
	\begin{itemize}
	\item End of mission procedure, 
	\item Driver closes the desk,
	\item Error condition detected on-board.
	\item The balise group orders to end up a radio communication.
	\end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}
\item \verb+isCompatible+ is set to 1 if a the track and the on-board systems
(function system version managment)
\end{description}

\subsection{Internal variables}
\label{subsec:internalvar}


The radio management module should take some decision with respect to internal
ERTMS on-board variables. This variable are listed blow. The variable definition
are detailed in subset-026-7.
\begin{itemize}
\item \verb+M_LEVEL+ $\in [0..4]$ represents the levels 0,1,2,3 or STM.
\item \verb+M_ mode+ $\in[0..15]$ represents the on-board operating mode.
\item \verb+safeRadioLink+ $\in \{\mathtt{NOCOM, COM, LOST}\}$ indicates if a safe radio communication is on.
\item \verb+radoComSession+ $\in \{\mathtt{TERMINATED, ESTABLISHED}\}$: indicates if a radio session is established with the track.
\end{itemize} 
Note that the \verb+safeRadioLink+ may be used for the messages given to the
driver.

% ----------------------------------------------------
\subsection{Behaviour}
\label{subsec:behavior}

The behaviour is described figure \ref{fig:behavior}.
A classical transaction starts with an order to established a communication with
an RBC. In this model we assume that the RBC belongs to the RBC accepting list.
Note that we have abstracted the different ways to contact an RBC (last known
number, number entered by the driver ...). Secondly, the MoRC sets up a safe radio
connection, then it initiates a radio communication with the RBC.
An order to terminate a radio communication session may occurred, in this case,
the MoRC sends a termination message to the RBC waits for the acknowledgement and
then releases the safe radio communication.
Our model does not manage the consistency of the successive order, we do not
impose any constraints to when the orders may occur. This may be done by external
tasks.

States \verb+INIT_COM+ and \verb+TERM_COM+ are decomposed as state automata
handling the maximal number of try and the time out of requests.

Sate \verb+COM+ is decomposed as an automaton, it handles the lost of safe
radio.
