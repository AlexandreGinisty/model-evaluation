The radio communication management module (MoRC) is the user application interacting
with Euroradio protocol. In this section we present the general behavior only, 
the actual details of how messages are transported are not relevant
for this description.

The MoRC is the part of the EVC (European vital computer) responsible for the
management of radio communication.
According to the specification this module interacts directly with the following
on-board modules, as shown in figure \ref{fig:arch}: 
\begin{itemize}
\item (DMI) driver module interface~: receives/displays information from/to the driver,
\item (RTM) radio transmission module~: receives/gives commands from/to the radio
network,
\item (BTM) balise transmission module~: sends transmission request from a balise group,
\item (JRU) Juridical recorder unit~: records part of the data exchange for
\item (OBU tasks) other on-board functions (SUBSET-026-4.5) used  by the MoRC such as:
\begin{itemize}
\item track conditions management functions  (SUBSET-026-3.12.1)
that determine for instance if the ETCS system of the track is compatible with the
system on-board.
\item Mode determination (SUBSET-026-3.12.4, SUBSET-026-4.6).

\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

The orders to initiate or terminates a radio communication may come from the
DMI, the BTM, and the RBC (radio block centre) through the RTM. The others OBU
tasks may also order a radio communication (see section\ref{subsec:abstaction}
for more details).

In figure \ref{fig:overview} the MoRC model - \emph{our test model} - is composed
with a the test environment (TE). The inputs and outputs
interfaces are explained in detail in section \ref{subsec:inputoutput}.
The test environment abstracts away all the others functions or blocks  which
the SUT may interact with.

The SUT block consists here of unique block that is the MoRC. The MoRC block
contains the internal variables used for the protocol implementation and the
state-charts describing its behavior. 
For the moment the constants used in this chapter and defined in
SUBSET-026.3-A.3.1 are not part of the MoRC block. At this stage of modelisation
it is not defined where they should be declared and recorded to keep track of
possible change or extension. I think they should be part of a special package
regrouping all this kind of information. In the current model they belong to the
system package.
